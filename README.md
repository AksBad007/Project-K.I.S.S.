### Inroduction

- Built on top of Flask, Project K.I.S.S. is a playground where frontend developers can practice their HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills by executing all three in real-time right on their browser screens.
- To keep users immersed, a music player and a To-Do List have been added.
- The site provides basic functionality as well such as Login, Signup and Edit Profile sections.
- On top of that, certain users are granted the role of Admin, giving them access to Admin Dashboard.
- A changelog section is there to show the stages the project went through during the development and deployment stages.
- Other than these, there are certain other things like the Submission section, Feedback section etc. that provide the necessary info. to Admins to improve the project further.
- Backed by MongoDB.

As of now, the project is only optimized for screens having 720p resolution or above.
